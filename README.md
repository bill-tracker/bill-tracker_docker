If you have any questions about anything or need help getting started, you'll probably want to join our slack channel at https://billtracker.slack.com/  You'll need an invite from Dee for that.  You can email me at mcdermottsolutions@gmail.com and I can ask Dee to send you the slack invite.  Sorry about the runaround, we're super excited that you're interested and would really love some new blood in this project!
